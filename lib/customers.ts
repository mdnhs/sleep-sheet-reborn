/**
 * Find (or create) the customer account behind a phone number.
 *
 * Guest checkout and POS both need this: a customer who never registered
 * still gets a real `users` row, so they persist independently of any single
 * order (delete the order and the customer survives, and still shows on the
 * Customers page) and so repeat orders from the same number land on the same
 * account rather than fragmenting into one row per order.
 *
 * Both call sites used to inline their own check-then-insert with nothing
 * behind it, which raced: two concurrent orders from the same phone could
 * both miss the lookup, and — when neither supplied an email, so both derived
 * the same `<phone>@<domain>` fallback — the loser hit the UNIQUE on email
 * and crashed the whole checkout with a 500. A real order was lost to what
 * should have been a no-op.
 *
 * The insert here is `ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING` against every unique constraint
 * on the table (phone and email both), so the losing writer inserts nothing
 * and re-reads the winner's row instead of throwing. That makes this safe to
 * call concurrently for the same phone.
