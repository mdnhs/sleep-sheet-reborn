// Storefront pages regenerate daily. This is a floor for the whole group: per
// the route-segment docs, the lowest revalidate across a route's layout and
// page decides the frequency for that entire route, so a page that needs to be
// fresher sets its own lower value (blog and testimonials do).
//
// The window is long because it is not the refresh mechanism, it is the
// fallback. Settings, products and categories all invalidate by tag the moment
// they are written (see lib/prefetch-home.ts and lib/meta-catalog/cache.ts), so
// nothing waits out the clock. What the clock does control is how often an
// otherwise idle site wakes the database: every expiry turns the next visitor
// or crawler into a fresh set of queries, and with ~100 storefront routes an
// hourly window is ~2,400 regenerations a day, spread thinly enough to keep the
// compute from ever suspending. Neon bills awake time, not query time — the
// project has spent 67 hours awake to do 28 seconds of actual SQL — so the
// spacing of queries is the cost, and this is the lever on it.
